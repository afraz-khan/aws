# SAM Samples
- SAM templates to deploy multiple simple Serverless solutions.
- There is code in the `src` directory for each individual template.
- Directory `gen` is used for the final output template that `sam package` or `aws cloudformation package` command generates.
- Have a look at `commands.sh` file. It has commands to deploy SAM templates.
- Make sure you create an S3 bucket beforehand before deploying.
